# CareAssist

## Where's the code?
This is our "master repo," with two submodules.  The Web Interface and the Wearable Interface are stored in two separate folders and are completely self contained. We tend to merge into master once development is done, so please checkout the master branch and create a branch off from the most recent master for further development.  Please refer to the rebase workflow guide for merging code back inside of the Contribution guide.
